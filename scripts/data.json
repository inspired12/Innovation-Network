In collaboration with its partners including the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Adient is developing novel polymers with exceptional strength and imaging characteristics for the demands of implantable absorbable medical devices. Overall, a game changing medical device platform is emerging with the potential of saving lives with minimal adverse events since the absorbable devices vanish from the body following intended use.","Year":"2012","size":"medium","Category":"biomedical"},
{"Name":"Admetsys","url":'http://www.admetsys.com',"Bio":"Admetsys has developed the first fully-automated glucose control system specifically for the needs of hospital and surgical care. The system attaches to a patient's intravenous line, and automatically measures blood glucose concentration in real time with no blood loss. From this, it creates an adaptive, computational model of each patient's metabolism, and infuses precisely-optimized, counterbalancing treatment—insulin to reduce high glycemic levels and glucose to raise and support falling levels.            For people at diabetic risk, glucose control is at its most crucial while in hospital or undergoing surgery. Correcting abnormal glucose levels and keeping them normal speeds recovery, prevents infection, and reduces complications. In short, it saves lives. To date, this has been difficult, highly labor-intensive, and imprecise. That is about to change.","Year":"2004","size":"medium","Category":"hardware"},
